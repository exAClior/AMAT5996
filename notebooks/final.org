*** 4.4: Power of Sigma Matrices
Problem 4.4. Calculate the following expressions,

(i) $(\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})^n$, and then

(ii) $(b \mathrm{I}+\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})^n$, for the scalar product
$\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$ of the Pauli matrix vector $\boldsymbol{\sigma} \equiv
\mathbf{n}_x \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x+\mathbf{n}_y \sigma_y+\mathbf{n}_z \boldsymbol{\sigma}_z$ by
an arbitrary $c$ -number vector $\mathbf{c}$, where $n \geqslant 0$ is an integer, and
$b$ is an arbitrary scalar $c$ number. (Change this to bI + i |c| \sigma, to use
exponential form)

Hint: For task (ii), you may like to use
the binomial theorem2, and then transform the result in a way enabling you to
use the same theorem backwards.

*** 6.1: Hyperfine Splitting
Give the degeneracy of the ground state if one neglects the magnetic interaction
between the nucleus and the external electron. We note $$
\left.\left.\left|m_{\mathrm{e}} ; m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle=\mid \text {
electron : } s_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2, m_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle \otimes \mid
\text { nucleus : } s_{\mathrm{n}}, m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ a basis of
the total spin states (external electron + nucleus).

*** 6.2: Energy Level of Hyperfine Splitting
We now take into account the interaction between the electron magnetic moment
$\mu_{\mathrm{e}}$ and the nuclear magnetic moment $\mu_{\mathrm{n}}$. As in the
hydrogen atom, one can write the corresponding Hamiltonian (restricted to the
spin subspace) as: $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{\hbar^2}
\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}, $$

where $A$ is a characteristic energy, and where
$\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}$ are
the spin operators of the electron and the nucleus, respectively. We want to
find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

We introduce the operators $\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, x} \pm i
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, y}$ and $\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, x} \pm
i \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, y}$.

(a) Show that $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{2 \hbar^2}\left(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},+}
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},-}+\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},-} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},+}+2
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, z} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, z}\right) $$

(b) Show that the two states $$ \left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}=s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle \quad \text { and } \quad\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 /
2 ; m_{\mathrm{n}}=-s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ are eigenstates of $\hat{H}$, and
give the corresponding eigenvalues.

(c) What is the action of $\hat{H}$ on the state $\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle$ with $m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq s_{\mathrm{n}}$ ? What is the
action of $\hat{H}$ on the state $\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle$ with $m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq-s_{\mathrm{n}}$ ? (d) Deduce from
these results that the eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$ can be calculated by
diagonalizing $2 \times 2$ matrices of the type: $$
\frac{A}{2}\left(\begin{array}{lr} m_{\mathrm{n}} &
\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
\\ \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
& -\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right) \end{array}\right) . $$

*** 7.3.1: Zeeman Effect
The system is placed in a constant uniform magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$
directed along the $z$ axis. The additional Zeeman Hamiltonian has the form $$
\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}}=\omega_1 \hat{S}_{1 z}+\omega_2 \hat{S}_{2 z} $$ where $\omega_1=-\gamma_1 B$
and $\omega_2=-\gamma_2 B$. 7.3.1 Matrix representation of the Zeeman Hamiltonian

(a) Taking into account the result of question 7.2.2 and setting $\omega=-\gamma B$, write
the action of $\hat{H}_Z$ on the basis states $\left\{\left|\sigma_1,
\sigma_2\right\rangle\right\}$.

(b) Write in terms of $A$ and $\hbar \omega$ the matrix representation of $$
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{A}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}} $$ in
the basis $\{|S, m\rangle\}$ of the total spin of the two particles.

(c) Give the numerical value of $\hbar \omega$ in $\mathrm{eV}$ for a field $B=1
\mathrm{~T}$. Is it easy experimentally to be in a strong field regime, i.e. $\hbar
\omega \gg A$ ?

A two-state system is characterized by the Hamiltonian
$$
H=H_{11}|1\rangle\left\langle 1\left|+H_{22}\right| 2\right\rangle\langle 2|+H_{12}[|1\rangle\langle 2|+| 2\rangle\langle 1|]
$$
where $H_{11}, H_{22}$, and $H_{12}$ are real numbers with the dimension of energy, and $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ are eigenkets of some observable $(\neq H)$. Find the energy eigenkets and corresponding energy eigenvalues. Make sure that your answer makes good sense for $H_{12}=0$.
1.14 A spin $\frac{1}{2}$ system is known to be in an eigenstate of $\mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ with eigenvalue $\hbar / 2$, where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is a unit vector lying in the $x z$-plane that makes an angle $\gamma$ with the positive $z$-axis.
a. Suppose $S_x$ is measured. What is the probability of getting $+\hbar / 2$ ?
b. Evaluate the dispersion in $S_x$, that is,
$$
\left\langle\left(S_x-\left\langle S_x\right\rangle\right)^2\right\rangle
$$
(For your own peace of mind check your answers for the special cases $\gamma=0, \pi / 2$, and $\pi$.)

*** 1.15
A beam of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ atoms goes through a series of Stern-Gerlach type measurements as follows.
a. The first measurement accepts $s_z=\hbar / 2$ atoms and rejects $s_z=-\hbar / 2$ atoms.
b. The second measurement accepts $s_n=\hbar / 2$ atoms and rejects $s_n=-\hbar / 2$ atoms, where $s_n$ is the eigenvalue of the operator $\mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$, with $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ making an angle $\beta$ in the $x z$-plane with respect to the $z$-axis.
c. The third measurement accepts $s_z=-\hbar / 2$ atoms and rejects $s_z=\hbar / 2$ atoms.
What is the intensity of the final $s_z=-\hbar / 2$ beam when the $s_z=\hbar / 2$ beam surviving the first measurement is normalized to unity? How must we orient the second measuring apparatus if we are to maximize the intensity of the final $s_z=-\hbar / 2$ beam?
*** 1.18
Two Hermitian operators anticommute:
$$
\{A, B\}=A B+B A=0 .
$$

Is it possible to have a simultaneous (that is, common) eigenket of $A$ and $B$ ? Prove or illustrate your assertion.
*** 1.19
Two observables $A_1$ and $A_2$, which do not involve time explicitly, are known not to commute,
$$
\left[A_1, A_2\right] \neq 0
$$
yet we also know that $A_1$ and $A_2$ both commute with the Hamiltonian:
$$
\left[A_1, H\right]=0, \quad\left[A_2, H\right]=0
$$

Prove that the energy eigenstates are, in general, degenerate. Are there exceptions? As an example, you may think of the central-force problem $H=\mathbf{p}^2 / 2 m+V(r)$, with $A_1 \rightarrow L_z, A_2 \rightarrow L_x$
*** 1.26
a. Prove that $(1 / \sqrt{2})\left(1+i \sigma_x\right)$, where the matrix $\sigma_x$ is given in (3.50), acting on a two-component spinor can be regarded as the matrix representation of the rotation operator about the $x$-axis by angle $-\pi / 2$. (The minus sign signifies that the rotation is clockwise.)

b. Construct the matrix representation of $S_z$ when the eigenkets of $S_y$ are used as base vectors.

*** 1.28
Construct the transformation matrix that connects the $S_z$ diagonal basis to the $S_x$ diagonal basis. Show that your result is consistent with the general relation
$$
U=\sum_r\left|b^{(r)}\right\rangle\left\langle a^{(r)}\right|
$$

*** 2.8: Heisenberg Picture
2.8 Consider a free-particle wave packet in one dimension. At $t=0$ it satisfies the minimum uncertainty relation
$$
\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle\left\langle(\Delta p)^2\right\rangle=\frac{\bar{h}^2}{4} \quad(t=0) .
$$

In addition, we know
$$
\langle x\rangle=\langle p\rangle=0 \quad(t=0) .
$$

Using the Heisenberg picture, obtain $\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_t$ as a function of $t(t \geq 0)$ when $\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_{t=0}$ is given. (Hint: Take advantage of the property of the minimumuncertainty wave packet you worked out in Chapter 1, Problem 1.20.)

*** 3.12: State Representation
a. Consider a pure ensemble of identically prepared spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems.
   Suppose the expectation values $\left\langle S_x\right\rangle$ and
   $\left\langle S_z\right\rangle$ and the sign of $\left\langle
   S_y\right\rangle$ are known. Show how we may determine the state vector. Why
   is it unnecessary to know the magnitude of $\left\langle S_y\right\rangle$ ?

b. Consider a mixed ensemble of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Suppose the ensemble
   averages $\left[S_x\right],\left[S_y\right]$, and $\left[S_z\right]$ are all
   known. Show how we may construct the $2 \times 2$ density matrix that
   characterizes the ensemble.
