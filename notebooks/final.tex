eigenket of \(A\) ? Justify your answer.
\subsubsection{1.12: Braket Notation to Matrix}
\label{sec:org02d45b2}
The Hamiltonian operator for a two-state system is given by $$
H=a(|1\rangle\langle 1|-| 2\rangle\langle 2|+| 1\rangle\langle 2|+|
2\rangle\langle 1|), $$ where \(a\) is a number with the dimension of energy. Find
the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding energy eigenkets (as linear

\subsubsection{2.8: Heisenberg Picture}
\label{sec:org8a46d5c}
2.8 Consider a free-particle wave packet in one dimension. At \(t=0\) it satisfies the minimum uncertainty relation
$$
\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle\left\langle(\Delta p)^2\right\rangle=\frac{\bar{h}^2}{4} \quad(t=0) .
$$

In addition, we know
$$
\langle x\rangle=\langle p\rangle=0 \quad(t=0) .
$$

Using the Heisenberg picture, obtain \(\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_t\) as a function of \(t(t \geq 0)\) when \(\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_{t=0}\) is given. (Hint: Take advantage of the property of the minimumuncertainty wave packet you worked out in Chapter 1, Problem 1.20.)

\item Consider a mixed ensemble of spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) systems. Suppose the ensemble
averages \(\left[S_x\right],\left[S_y\right]\), and \(\left[S_z\right]\) are all

\subsubsection{6.1: Hyperfine Splitting}
\label{sec:orgb8245e7}
Give the degeneracy of the ground state if one neglects the magnetic interaction
between the nucleus and the external electron. We note $$
\left.\left.\left|m_{\mathrm{e}} ; m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle=\mid \text {
electron : } s_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2, m_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle \otimes \mid
\text { nucleus : } s_{\mathrm{n}}, m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ a basis of
the total spin states (external electron + nucleus).
\subsubsection{6.2: Energy Level of Hyperfine Splitting}
\label{sec:org6de7bea}
We now take into account the interaction between the electron magnetic moment
\(\mu_{\mathrm{e}}\) and the nuclear magnetic moment \(\mu_{\mathrm{n}}\). As in the
hydrogen atom, one can write the corresponding Hamiltonian (restricted to the
spin subspace) as: $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{\hbar^2}
\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}, $$

where \(A\) is a characteristic energy, and where
\(\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}}\) and \(\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}\) are
the spin operators of the electron and the nucleus, respectively. We want to
find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

We introduce the operators \(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, x} \pm i
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, y}\) and \(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, x} \pm
i \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, y}\).

(a) Show that $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{2 \hbar^2}\left(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},+}
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},-}+\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},-} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},+}+2
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, z} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, z}\right) $$

(b) Show that the two states $$ \left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}=s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle \quad \text { and } \quad\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 /
2 ; m_{\mathrm{n}}=-s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ are eigenstates of \(\hat{H}\), and
give the corresponding eigenvalues.

(c) What is the action of \(\hat{H}\) on the state \(\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle\) with \(m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq s_{\mathrm{n}}\) ? What is the
action of \(\hat{H}\) on the state \(\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle\) with \(m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq-s_{\mathrm{n}}\) ? (d) Deduce from
these results that the eigenvalues of \(\hat{H}\) can be calculated by
diagonalizing \(2 \times 2\) matrices of the type: $$
\frac{A}{2}\left(\begin{array}{lr} m_{\mathrm{n}} &
\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
\\ \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
& -\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right) \end{array}\right) . $$
\subsubsection{7.3.1: Zeeman Effect}
\label{sec:org3aacd83}
The system is placed in a constant uniform magnetic field \(\boldsymbol{B}\)
directed along the \(z\) axis. The additional Zeeman Hamiltonian has the form $$
\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}}=\omega_1 \hat{S}_{1 z}+\omega_2 \hat{S}_{2 z} $$ where \(\omega_1=-\gamma_1 B\)
and \(\omega_2=-\gamma_2 B\). 7.3.1 Matrix representation of the Zeeman Hamiltonian

(a) Taking into account the result of question 7.2.2 and setting \(\omega=-\gamma B\), write
the action of \(\hat{H}_Z\) on the basis states \(\left\{\left|\sigma_1,
\sigma_2\right\rangle\right\}\).

(b) Write in terms of \(A\) and \(\hbar \omega\) the matrix representation of $$
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{A}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}} $$ in
the basis \(\{|S, m\rangle\}\) of the total spin of the two particles.

(c) Give the numerical value of \(\hbar \omega\) in \(\mathrm{eV}\) for a field \(B=1
\mathrm{~T}\). Is it easy experimentally to be in a strong field regime, i.e. \(\hbar
\omega \gg A\) ?

Problem 3: Outer Products (10 pts)
(a) (3 pts) Let \(|+\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)\). Write out the two by two matrix \(|+\rangle\langle+|\) in the computational basis, \(|0\rangle,|1\rangle\).
(b) (4 pts) Let \(|-i\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle)\) and \(|+i\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle-i|1\rangle)\). Suppose that we are given two qubits whose wave function is \(\frac{1}{2}|00\rangle+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|11\rangle\). If we measure the first of these qubits in the \(|+i\rangle,|-i\rangle\) basis, what are the probabilities of these two outcomes? What is the wave function of these two qubits after the measurement for each of these two possible outcomes?
(c) (3 pts) Define the four dimensional matrix \(V=|00\rangle\left\langle 00\left|+e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}\right| 01\right\rangle\langle 01|+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|10\rangle\langle 10|+i| 11\rangle\langle 10|+i| 10\rangle\langle 11|+| 11\rangle\langle 11|)\). Is this matrix unitary? That is does \(V V^{\dagger}=I\) ?

Problem 4: n Qubits! (10 pts)
In this problem we will deal with \(n\) qubits.
(a) (4 pts) Suppose that we have \(n\) qubits which have the wave function \(|0\rangle=|0,0, \ldots, 0\rangle\). If we now apply the \(n\) qubit Pauli \(X\) to these \(n\) qubits, \(X^{\otimes n}\) (where \(X\) is defined Problem 2), what is the resulting \(n\) qubit state? Your answer should be a single computational basis state.
(b) (4 pts) Recall the definition of the Hadamard from Problem 1. Suppose we apply the \(n\) qubit Hadamard, \(H^{\otimes n}\) to \(\left(X^{\otimes n}\right)|0\rangle\). ( \(H\) is defined in Problem 1.) What is the resulting \(n\) qubit wave function? Express it as a sum over computational basis kets, i.e. in the form \(\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} a_x|x\rangle\), where \(a_x\) is some function of \(x\) which you must find a formula for.
(c) (2 pts) \(H^{\otimes n} X^{\otimes n} H^{\otimes n}\) can be expressed as \(A^{\otimes n}\). What is \(A\) ?
