\subsubsection{4.4: Power of Sigma Matrices}
\label{sec:orgec1a20b}
Problem 4.4. Calculate the following expressions,

(i) \((\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})^n\), and then

(ii) \((b \mathrm{I}+\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})^n\), for the scalar product
\(\mathbf{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) of the Pauli matrix vector \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \equiv
\mathbf{n}_x \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x+\mathbf{n}_y \sigma_y+\mathbf{n}_z \boldsymbol{\sigma}_z\) by
an arbitrary \(c\) -number vector \(\mathbf{c}\), where \(n \geqslant 0\) is an integer, and
\(b\) is an arbitrary scalar \(c\) number. (Change this to bI + i |c| \(\sigma\), to use
exponential form)

Hint: For task (ii), you may like to use
the binomial theorem2, and then transform the result in a way enabling you to
use the same theorem backwards.
\subsubsection{4.19: Eigenvalue and Measurement}
\label{sec:orgc24f8a3}
Problem 4.19. In a certain basis, the Hamiltonian of a two-level system is
described by the matrix $$ \mathrm{H}=\left(\begin{array}{cc} E_1 & 0 \\ 0 & E_2
\end{array}\right), \quad \text { with } E_1 \neq E_2, $$ while the operator of
some observable \(A\) of this system, by the matrix $$
\mathrm{A}=\left(\begin{array}{ll} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{array}\right) $$

For the system's state with the energy definitely equal to \(E_1\), find the
possible results of measurements of the observable \(A\) and the probabilities of
the corresponding measurement outcomes.

\subsubsection{5.9: Fock State and Ladder Operator}

and \(\begin{aligned} \left\langle n^{\prime}|\hat{x}^{2}| n\right\rangle & =

\subsubsection{6.1: Hyperfine Splitting}
\label{sec:org87b33ff}
Give the degeneracy of the ground state if one neglects the magnetic interaction
between the nucleus and the external electron. We note $$
\left.\left.\left|m_{\mathrm{e}} ; m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle=\mid \text {
electron : } s_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2, m_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle \otimes \mid
\text { nucleus : } s_{\mathrm{n}}, m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ a basis of
the total spin states (external electron + nucleus).
\subsubsection{6.2: Energy Level of Hyperfine Splitting}
\label{sec:orgf52a3c8}
We now take into account the interaction between the electron magnetic moment
\(\mu_{\mathrm{e}}\) and the nuclear magnetic moment \(\mu_{\mathrm{n}}\). As in the
hydrogen atom, one can write the corresponding Hamiltonian (restricted to the
spin subspace) as: $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{\hbar^2}
\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}, $$

where \(A\) is a characteristic energy, and where
\(\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{e}}\) and \(\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_{\mathrm{n}}\) are
the spin operators of the electron and the nucleus, respectively. We want to
find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

We introduce the operators \(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, x} \pm i
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, y}\) and \(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, \pm}=\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, x} \pm
i \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, y}\).

(a) Show that $$ \hat{H}=\frac{A}{2 \hbar^2}\left(\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},+}
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},-}+\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e},-} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n},+}+2
\hat{S}_{\mathrm{e}, z} \hat{S}_{\mathrm{n}, z}\right) $$

(b) Show that the two states $$ \left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}=s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle \quad \text { and } \quad\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 /
2 ; m_{\mathrm{n}}=-s_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle $$ are eigenstates of \(\hat{H}\), and
give the corresponding eigenvalues.

(c) What is the action of \(\hat{H}\) on the state \(\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle\) with \(m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq s_{\mathrm{n}}\) ? What is the
action of \(\hat{H}\) on the state \(\left|m_{\mathrm{e}}=-1 / 2 ;
m_{\mathrm{n}}\right\rangle\) with \(m_{\mathrm{n}} \neq-s_{\mathrm{n}}\) ? (d) Deduce from
these results that the eigenvalues of \(\hat{H}\) can be calculated by
diagonalizing \(2 \times 2\) matrices of the type: $$
\frac{A}{2}\left(\begin{array}{lr} m_{\mathrm{n}} &
\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
\\ \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{n}}\left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)-m_{\mathrm{n}}\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right)}
& -\left(m_{\mathrm{n}}+1\right) \end{array}\right) . $$
\subsubsection{7.3.1: Zeeman Effect}
\label{sec:org6e5e67d}
The system is placed in a constant uniform magnetic field \(\boldsymbol{B}\)
directed along the \(z\) axis. The additional Zeeman Hamiltonian has the form $$
\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}}=\omega_1 \hat{S}_{1 z}+\omega_2 \hat{S}_{2 z} $$ where \(\omega_1=-\gamma_1 B\)
and \(\omega_2=-\gamma_2 B\). 7.3.1 Matrix representation of the Zeeman Hamiltonian

(a) Taking into account the result of question 7.2.2 and setting \(\omega=-\gamma B\), write
the action of \(\hat{H}_Z\) on the basis states \(\left\{\left|\sigma_1,
\sigma_2\right\rangle\right\}\).

(b) Write in terms of \(A\) and \(\hbar \omega\) the matrix representation of $$
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\mathrm{SS}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{A}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{Z}} $$ in
the basis \(\{|S, m\rangle\}\) of the total spin of the two particles.

(c) Give the numerical value of \(\hbar \omega\) in \(\mathrm{eV}\) for a field \(B=1
\mathrm{~T}\). Is it easy experimentally to be in a strong field regime, i.e. \(\hbar
\omega \gg A\) ?

2\rangle\langle 1|), $$ where \(a\) is a number with the dimension of energy. Find
the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding energy eigenkets (as linear
combinations of \(|1\rangle\) and \(|2\rangle\) ).
\subsubsection{1.13}
\label{sec:orgc10b3c4}
A two-state system is characterized by the Hamiltonian
$$
H=H_{11}|1\rangle\left\langle 1\left|+H_{22}\right| 2\right\rangle\langle 2|+H_{12}[|1\rangle\langle 2|+| 2\rangle\langle 1|]
$$
where \(H_{11}, H_{22}\), and \(H_{12}\) are real numbers with the dimension of energy, and \(|1\rangle\) and \(|2\rangle\) are eigenkets of some observable \((\neq H)\). Find the energy eigenkets and corresponding energy eigenvalues. Make sure that your answer makes good sense for \(H_{12}=0\).
1.14 A spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) system is known to be in an eigenstate of \(\mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\) with eigenvalue \(\hbar / 2\), where \(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) is a unit vector lying in the \$x z\$-plane that makes an angle \(\gamma\) with the positive \$z\$-axis.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose \(S_x\) is measured. What is the probability of getting \(+\hbar / 2\) ?
\item Evaluate the dispersion in \(S_x\), that is,
\end{enumerate}
$$
\left\langle\left(S_x-\left\langle S_x\right\rangle\right)^2\right\rangle
$$
(For your own peace of mind check your answers for the special cases \(\gamma=0, \pi / 2\), and \(\pi\).)
\subsubsection{1.14}
\label{sec:org29509ff}
A spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) system is known to be in an eigenstate of \(\mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\) with eigenvalue \(\hbar / 2\), where \(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) is a unit vector lying in the \$x z\$-plane that makes an angle \(\gamma\) with the positive \$z\$-axis.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Evaluate the dispersion in \(S_x\), that is,
\end{enumerate}
$$
\left\langle\left(S_x-\left\langle S_x\right\rangle\right)^2\right\rangle
$$
(For your own peace of mind check your answers for the special cases \(\gamma=0, \pi / 2\), and \(\pi\).)
\subsubsection{1.15}
\label{sec:orgea5c64e}
A beam of spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) atoms goes through a series of Stern-Gerlach type measurements as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first measurement accepts \(s_z=\hbar / 2\) atoms and rejects \(s_z=-\hbar / 2\) atoms.
\item The second measurement accepts \(s_n=\hbar / 2\) atoms and rejects \(s_n=-\hbar / 2\) atoms, where \(s_n\) is the eigenvalue of the operator \(\mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\), with \(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) making an angle \(\beta\) in the \$x z\$-plane with respect to the \$z\$-axis.
\item The third measurement accepts \(s_z=-\hbar / 2\) atoms and rejects \(s_z=\hbar / 2\) atoms.
\end{enumerate}
What is the intensity of the final \(s_z=-\hbar / 2\) beam when the \(s_z=\hbar / 2\) beam surviving the first measurement is normalized to unity? How must we orient the second measuring apparatus if we are to maximize the intensity of the final \(s_z=-\hbar / 2\) beam?
\subsubsection{1.18}
\label{sec:org6689bea}
Two Hermitian operators anticommute:
$$
\{A, B\}=A B+B A=0 .
$$

Is it possible to have a simultaneous (that is, common) eigenket of \(A\) and \(B\) ? Prove or illustrate your assertion.
\subsubsection{1.19}
\label{sec:orgeff3db8}
Two observables \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), which do not involve time explicitly, are known not to commute,
$$
\left[A_1, A_2\right] \neq 0
$$
yet we also know that \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) both commute with the Hamiltonian:
$$
\left[A_1, H\right]=0, \quad\left[A_2, H\right]=0
$$

Prove that the energy eigenstates are, in general, degenerate. Are there exceptions? As an example, you may think of the central-force problem \(H=\mathbf{p}^2 / 2 m+V(r)\), with \(A_1 \rightarrow L_z, A_2 \rightarrow L_x\)
\subsubsection{1.26}
\label{sec:org9581c1c}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that \((1 / \sqrt{2})\left(1+i \sigma_x\right)\), where the matrix \(\sigma_x\) is given in (3.50), acting on a two-component spinor can be regarded as the matrix representation of the rotation operator about the \$x\$-axis by angle \(-\pi / 2\). (The minus sign signifies that the rotation is clockwise.)

\item Construct the matrix representation of \(S_z\) when the eigenkets of \(S_y\) are used as base vectors.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{1.28}
\label{sec:org7757026}
Construct the transformation matrix that connects the \(S_z\) diagonal basis to the \(S_x\) diagonal basis. Show that your result is consistent with the general relation
$$
U=\sum_r\left|b^{(r)}\right\rangle\left\langle a^{(r)}\right|
$$
\subsection{Chapter 2}
\label{sec:org41cfae7}

\subsubsection{2.8: Heisenberg Picture}
\label{sec:org69ae2b3}
2.8 Consider a free-particle wave packet in one dimension. At \(t=0\) it satisfies the minimum uncertainty relation
$$
\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle\left\langle(\Delta p)^2\right\rangle=\frac{\bar{h}^2}{4} \quad(t=0) .
$$

In addition, we know
$$
\langle x\rangle=\langle p\rangle=0 \quad(t=0) .
$$

Using the Heisenberg picture, obtain \(\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_t\) as a function of \(t(t \geq 0)\) when \(\left\langle(\Delta x)^2\right\rangle_{t=0}\) is given. (Hint: Take advantage of the property of the minimumuncertainty wave packet you worked out in Chapter 1, Problem 1.20.)
\subsection{Chapter 3}
\label{sec:org64ef16d}
\subsubsection{3.12: State Representation}
\label{sec:orga0706d8}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a pure ensemble of identically prepared spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) systems.
Suppose the expectation values \(\left\langle S_x\right\rangle\) and
\(\left\langle S_z\right\rangle\) and the sign of \(\left\langle
   S_y\right\rangle\) are known. Show how we may determine the state vector. Why
is it unnecessary to know the magnitude of \(\left\langle S_y\right\rangle\) ?

\item Consider a mixed ensemble of spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) systems. Suppose the ensemble
averages \(\left[S_x\right],\left[S_y\right]\), and \(\left[S_z\right]\) are all
known. Show how we may construct the \(2 \times 2\) density matrix that
characterizes the ensemble.
